# Submission app by Mykyta Brazhynskyy

All core features listed in specs were implemented. There is no name over comments, just because user in datebase doesn't have any. Implemented also bonus functionality and error checking in create post screen.

To run the app, all you need to do is go to project root and:
```npm
npm install
react-native run-android
```
